## Inspiration

> En Hao’s rambles: we wrote this at 3am don’t expect much.

Getting nagged by our boss all the time for procrastinating and not doing our work on time, we decided that we need a solution to this, we need to punish ourselves. Which is why we came up with PaaS, a one stop solution, and a 10000x percent effective solution to procrastination. We wanted to share this idea with the entire world in hopes that no boss and parent will ever be pissed at you for procrastinating anymore, improving your mental health significantly.

> En Hao’s rambles: This app made me a super worker! I finished this README before I went to sleep! I didn’t need to sleep at all because I kept this app running! I love it!
>
> Lynus comment:
> Sure, here are a few quotes that summarise the concept of “urgency driving progress”:
>
> 1. Due tomorrow, do tomorrow.
> 2. Diamonds form under pressure.
> 3. The last minute is often the most productive.
>
> Aekas says: This product made me become phenomenally more productive, working 25/8 at maximal efficiency. I am eternally grateful to PaaS for changing my life.

## What it does

This app is an app aimed at enhancing a user’s productivity:

1. The user opens this productivity app.
2. Periodically, the app will activate a big red button on your screen. It’s always on top of any other window, so there’s no excuse for missing it!
3. Click that button within a few seconds and you can return to doing your productive work.
4. However, if you don't, there are consequences. You will get a glimpse into your future: late reminders for your work, system errors, and more!
5. To bail out of this, at random intervals, you will bet on a coin flip. (As a penalty for slacking, the coin flip becomes extra challenging, with the buttons moving to random locations on the screen at least 5 times.)
    - Guess the outcome of the coin flip correctly, and you will be shown a congratulatory video before the app absolves you of your sins (slacking). 
    - Guess wrongly and you will be shown an unskippable ad before having to wait for the next coinflip. Don’t worry - the reminders, panic messages, and popups will continue to be with you!
6. Steps 2 to 5 periodically to make sure you are paying attention and do not procrastinate your work !


## How we built it

- electron.js
- laptops
- visual studio code
- google
- stackoverflow

## Challenges we ran into

- create-electron-app did not work
- ran out of free Sonnet-3.5 messages
- the button bro fr I get interrupted every 15 seconds to click the button
- couldn’t get delete system32 to work

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

> Lynus comment: This app made in 24 hours is arguably more complete and polished than any of my past module projects (which were also all submitted late)
>
> Aekas says: ^^ + Best hackathon experience ever with this bunch.
>
> En Hao’s rambles: We actually built a functional app. Like straight up my first hackathon experience and my first electron development experience. 10/10 would do again with this bunch <3 and now enhanced by this same app!

## Lessons we learnt

- javascript
- electron framework
- working together as a team - epic bonding thx hack n roll
- how a hackathon works (best hackathon fr)
- Human psychology (how to irritate and annoy increase human productivity)

## What’s next?

Knowing confidently that we will achieve great success and response from this application, this team looks forward to further expanding its horizons into productivity applications and iterations of this application, to potentially 20000x productivity. In the future we will utilise and enhance our platform not only drive productivity but also fosters innovation and inclusivity, shaping a better future for all.
